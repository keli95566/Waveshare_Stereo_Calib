# Waveshare Stereo Vision Extrinsic and Intrinsic Calibration


Camera calibration is important for doing accurate 3D measurement. 
This project explore techniques to calibrate [Wave share Stereo Camera](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/IMX219-83_Stereo_Camera) using opencv Python for building a 3D sensor using Jetson Nano.

To get started with the basic of CSI camera, go to the original repository.

## Intrinsic Calibration

Purposes:

* correct artifacts of camera lenses such as distortion.
* estimate accurate focal length of the camera.
* output camera matrix to correct future images. 

Usage:

## Extrinsic Calibration

Purposes:

* calcualte camera positions.
* calculate rotation matrix of the cameras.
* output Q matrix for accurate disparity mapping.
